A comparative distribution of the proportion of Oomycete proteomes and predicted secretomes which have carbohydrate digesting activity. The schematic phylogeny at the top indicates the relationship between different oomycete species with the dominant lifestyle of each species indicated by text colour.  Specifically, green text (Phytophthora species) indicates hemibiotrophy, blue (Hyaloperonospora and Albugo) indicates obligate biotrophy, teal (Pythium) indicates nectrophy, orange (Saprolegnia) indicates both saprotrophy and necrotrophy, finally, black indicates unknown (Hyphochytrium) or non-oomycete (Ectocarpus and Thalassiosira).  The first heat map in white/purple indicates the proportion of proteome of each organism (organised columnwise) which was identified as belonging to a particular CAZY (www.cazy.org) database category using BLASTP with an expectation of 1e-5.  The number listed is the proportion and the colouring relates to magnitude of the listed number (as shown by scale bar).
The second heatmap in blue/yellow is largely the same but instead indicates the proportion of the secretome (predicted via a custom pipeline https://github.com/fmaguire/predict_secretome/tree/refactor) that is identified as belonging to each of these CAZY categories. 
Finally, the bottom barplot shows the proportion of the secretome for each organism which is predicted to be secreted by the above mentioned pipeline.
